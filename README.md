# Diabetes-Classification  
- The main objective of this project is to come up with a predictor which best classifies the data. Accuracy of the prediction takes precedence over the model’s explainability.  
- Initially began by fitting basic models like Logistic Regression and KNN as these models are simple and have very good interpretability.  
- The results were not promising enough, so proceeded to fit ensemble models using boosting and bagging techniques.  
- In each of these models, F1 Score is given higher importance over accuracy of the prediction as there is already very high class imbalance. Hence the aim will be to reduce the False Positives and False Negatives to maximum extent.
